# Ore Height Indicator PRD (Fabric 1.21.1)

## Goal
Build a client-side Fabric mod for Minecraft 1.21.1 that shows the current Y-level and likely ores with percentages for mining decisions.

## Core UX (MVP)
- Toggle a compact HUD with a keybind (default `H`).
- Show current player Y-level.
- Show top ores sorted by percentage at that Y-level.
- Keep UI simple and readable during mining.

## Data Strategy
- Default provider: static vanilla 1.21.1 ore distribution curves.
- Architecture must include a provider interface for future dynamic worldgen extraction.
- Dynamic provider is out of MVP scope and disabled by default.

## Performance Requirements
- Recalculate at most every 5-10 ticks.
- Skip recalculation when Y-level has not changed.
- No heavy scans/registry traversal in render callback.
- Minimize per-frame allocations in HUD rendering path.
- Do no update work while HUD is hidden.

## Non-Goals (MVP)
- Biome-aware exact simulation.
- Chunk scanning or ore detection.
- Full worldgen parser for all datapacks/modpacks.
- Complex configurable UI screens.

## Success Criteria
- Mod runs on Fabric + Minecraft 1.21.1.
- HUD toggles on/off reliably.
- Ore list updates while moving vertically.
- FPS impact remains minimal and no visible stutter is introduced in normal mining movement.
- Codebase is prepared for a future dynamic provider without refactoring HUD logic.

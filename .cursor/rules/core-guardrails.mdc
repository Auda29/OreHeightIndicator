# Core Guardrails

- **Scope Discipline**
  - Deliver only the requested change.
  - Avoid drive-by refactors and unrelated cleanup.
  - If you spot unrelated issues, document them separately.

- **Quality and Verification**
  - Every code change includes matching tests where applicable.
  - Run project lint, tests, and type checks before completion when commands exist.
  - Resolve failures before adding more changes.

- **Security and Secrets**
  - Never commit credentials, tokens, private keys, or generated secret files.
  - Prefer safe defaults and explicit validation on user input boundaries.

- **Change Management**
  - Use one logical change per PR.
  - Follow Conventional Commits for commit messages.
  - Use the repository PR template for every pull request.

# Subagent Delegation

- **When to Delegate**
  - Delegate when a task spans more than three files or multiple concerns.
  - Delegate for parallelizable discovery, testing strategy, and documentation impact.
  - Keep simple single-file fixes in the primary agent.

- **Role Contracts**
  - Scout: returns impact map, touched files, dependencies, and risks.
  - Implementer: returns focused diff-ready implementation steps.
  - Tester: returns coverage gaps, test matrix, and regression risks.
  - Doc: returns required documentation updates and ADR recommendation.

- **Parallelism Rules**
  - Use parallel subagents for independent tracks.
  - Use sequential delegation when one output is input for the next step.
  - Cap concurrent subagents to the configured maximum.

- **Output Requirements**
  - Every subagent output includes assumptions, concrete paths, and next actions.
  - No subagent should perform unrelated refactors.
  - Primary agent consolidates decisions and owns final patch quality.
